# CS489 - WSC

## Webshop problem description
The company WSC (We Sell Cheap) wants to sell products over the Internet. So we need to develop a webshop where customers can buy products online. WSC sells various products, from books to computers to toilet paper.
WSC now offers their products through a catalog that they send to their customers every three months. They hope that with an online shop they can increase the number of customers and the number of orders.

It is important that the webshop is very user friendly. It should be easy to find products or browse through the different product categories. For example, it should be possible to select the category "books", and then should see all products of books. If we have found a product, then we can add it to the shopping cart. We should then see the content of the shopping cart

Also checking out the shopping cart should be very user friendly. The webshop system should store the customer data so that customers have to enter their personal data and payment information only once. When a customer places an order, the system will automatically send an order confirmation by email to the customer. All orders must be paid by credit card. The shop uses an external credit card verification system to check the credit card information

It should be possible for customers to place a "product review" for a product that they bought. These product reviews are shown in the detailed description of a particular product.

The shop application is managed by WSC staff that can add and remove products, and perform all the normal management functions.
Also, the application can generate reports for management support.
WCS has an already existing order application that process the incoming orders. The web shop application should use this existing order application to process orders.
